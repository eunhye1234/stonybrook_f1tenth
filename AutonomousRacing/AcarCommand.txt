- Steps to launch manual control:

	1: start ROS by typing "$ roscore" into a terminal
	2: open another terminal and type "$ cd f1tenth_ws"
	3: compile the project by typing "$ catkin_make"
	4: add project to path by typing "$ source devel/setup.bash"
	5: launch manual control with "$ roslaunch racecar teleop.launch"

- List all ROS topics: "$ rostopic list"

- Get measurements:

 	1. record a ROS topic: "$ rosbag record scan vesc/odom
	2. convert bag to .csv file: "$ rostopic echo -b filename.bag -p topicname > filename.csv 
	3. in our case: rosbag record -O measurement.bag /vesc/odom /vesc/sensors/core /scan /vesc/low_level/ackermann_cmd_mux/input/teleop /vesc/sensors/servo_position_command 

- Tmux:
	
	1. split terminal horizontally: Cstr + b  + %
	2. split terminal vertically: Cstr + b + "

- IP address: if the IP address changed, one has to change it in ./bashrc for ROS to work again

- Copying recorded measurements from the F1tentth car to my personal computer via the command line:

  "scp -r ccri-batch2-car3@130.245.70.43:/home/ccri-batch2-car3/Measurements/racetrack_9 /home/niklas/Documents/Repositories/AutonomousRacing/measurements/racetrack_9"
